### Contribution guidelines

You can contribute by:

-   Adding new resources or categories
-   Updating existing content (descriptions, links, etc.)
-   Removing outdated or irrelevant content
-   Fixing broken links or formatting issues
-   Improving documentation or usage examples

Please open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to format your markdown files with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) before submitting a pull request.

```bash
npx prettier --write --end-of-line lf --print-width 100 --single-quote --tab-width 4 .
```

Apologies for not having set up a pre-commit hook to do this automatically. I don't want to pollute the repository with configuration files.

Use the following commit message format:

```bash
<type>: <subject>
```

-   `<type>`: `[]` for new files, `[+]` for new content, `[-]` for removed content, `[*]` for updated content.
-   `<subject>`: Use the imperative, present tense: "add" not "added" nor "adds".

For example:

```bash
[*]: update awesome-node-packages.md
```

```bash
[+]: add awesome-cloud-services.md
```

```bash
[-]: remove awesome-cloud-services.md
```

```bash
[]: add awesome-cloud-services.md
```
